# QR Code Generator Test Report

## Overview

I tested my QR code generator manually by running the test script and checking if everything works.

## Test Environment

- **Date**: October 2, 2025
- **Test Method**: Running test.js and looking at console output
- **Test File**: `test/test.js`

## Test Results

### 1. Basic QR Code Generation

**What I tested**: Can the code make a QR matrix from text?

**Result**: Works fine

- Got a 21x21 matrix when I input "Hello"
- The matrix has 0s and 1s like it should
- Didn't crash or anything

### 2. ASCII Rendering

**What I tested**: Does it show the QR code visually?

**Result**: Yes it works

- Makes ASCII art with those block characters ██
- Has white space around the edges
- Actually looks like a QR code when printed

### 3. Valid Input Testing

**What I tested**: Making sure good inputs don't get rejected

**Tried these**:

- "Hello" in byte mode - ok
- "123456" in numeric mode - ok
- "HELLO123" in alphanumeric mode - ok

**Result**: All worked, no errors

### 4. Invalid Input Testing

**What I tested**: Bad inputs should be rejected

**Tried these**:

- Empty string - got rejected ✓
- "abc123" in numeric mode - got rejected ✓
- "hello world" in alphanumeric mode - got rejected ✓
- Really long text - got rejected ✓

**Result**: Everything that should fail did fail with error messages

### 5. Data Encoding

**What I tested**: Converting text to the codeword format

**Result**: Seems to work

- "Test" became 19 codewords (which is right for version 1)
- All values between 0-255 like they should be
- Includes padding at the end

### 6. Bits Conversion

**What I tested**: Converting codewords to binary bits

**Result**: Working correctly

- [72,101,108,108,111] became 40 bits total
- That's 8 bits per codeword which is what I expected
- The binary looks right when I checked the first few

### 7. Different Mask Patterns

**What I tested**: Testing mask patterns 0-3

**Result**: All worked

- Mask 0: ok
- Mask 1: ok
- Mask 2: ok
- Mask 3: ok

No crashes or errors

### 8. Full Test

**What I tested**: Complete process from text to ASCII QR code

**Tried**: "Hi", "123", "QR"

**Result**: All good

- All made 21x21 matrices
- ASCII output looks like QR codes
- No errors in the process

## Summary

Everything I tested worked. Got through all 8 tests without any failures.

The library can:

- Make QR matrices from text
- Check if inputs are valid
- Show QR codes as ASCII art
- Handle different text encoding modes
- Use different mask patterns
- Do the whole process end-to-end

## Notes

- Only tested version 1 QR codes (the 21x21 size)
- Configures but does not implement error correction at only the low level (L)
- The ASCII QR codes look right visually
- All the numbers stayed in the 0-255 range like they should

## What's Next

Implementing error correction and manual scanning tests.
