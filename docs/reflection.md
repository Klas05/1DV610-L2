# Clean Code Reflection - Public Function Names

| Function Name        | Description                                                                                      | Clean Code Rule Applied           | Reflection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generateQRCode`     | Main library function that creates a QR code matrix from input text with optional configuration. | **Use Intention-Revealing Names** | ✅ The name immediately reveals what the function does without needing to read implementation or comments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `renderASCIIMatrix`  | Converts a QR code matrix into ASCII art representation for console/text display.                | **Use Searchable Names**          | ✅ Contains specific keywords (ASCII, render, matrix) that make it easy to find when searching the codebase. Renaming it to only renderASCII is a thought I've had since it takes a matrix as an argument, which tells the developer already what the function is rendering in ASCII.                                                 |
| `validateInput`      | Checks if the provided text and options are valid for QR code generation.                        | **Use Verbs for Functions**       | ✅ Follows Clean Code principle that function names should be verbs indicating the action performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `buildDataCodewords` | Encodes input text into data codewords (bytes) according to QR code specification.               | **Use Domain Names**              | ✅ Uses "codewords" which is specific QR code domain terminology that domain experts would understand. Could be renamed to buildDataBytes since a codeword is equal to a byte which would instead be a solution domain named function. Because of educational purposes I went ahead and used codewords since qr codes are new for me. |
| `codewordsToBits`    | Utility function that converts an array of codewords (bytes) into a bit string.                  | **Make Meaningful Distinctions**  | ✅ Clearly distinguishes this conversion function from other similar functions by specifying both input and output types.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Previously in my coding experience I believe to have had reasonably named function/variables etc. but after reading chapter 2 I can look back and see some areas I could've named better. For example i don't believe all my functions had a verb to clearly describe what it did or made meaningful distinctions such as naming variables similar to eachother instead of making up a distinctful name (x, x2). There is one thing that I would like to disagree with and that is to use solution domain names instead of problem domain names. Personally I would like the code and documentation to use the specific terminology for the current problem domain instead of a more general solution domain name.

# Clean Code Reflection - Function Size (Chapter 3)

| Function Name                   | Lines of Code | Reflection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#shouldMask(MaskApplier)`      | 11            | **Switch Statements**: ⚠️ This is definitely my biggest function because of the switch with all the mask pattern cases. Each case is pretty simple on its own, but together they make the function too long. I could probably break this down, but didn't find, in my opinion, a good way to do so. |
| `#placeFinderPattern(QRMatrix)` | 10            | **Reading Code from Top to Bottom**: ✅ This function does just one thing, puts a finder pattern on the matrix. The big array with the pattern data has to be there, and I need the nested loops to place it correctly. I think this is okay even though it's a bit long.                              |
| `#placeSeparator(QRMatrix)`     | 9             | **Do One Thing**: ⚠️ This function is getting pretty big with all the loops and checks for boundaries. I could probably break some of this logic out into smaller helper functions to make it easier to read.                                                                                      |
| `build(QRMatrix)`               | 8             | **Do One Thing**: ✅ This function puts together the whole QR matrix by calling other methods. It has one job, building the matrix, but I could maybe make the steps more explicit by breaking it down further.                                                                                  |
| `renderASCII(QRRenderer)`       | 8             | **Small Functions**: ✅ This one seems fine to me. It does one thing (makes ASCII art from the matrix) and the nested loops are necessary to go through all the rows and columns. Pretty focused on its job.                                                                                       |

After reading Chapter 3, I can see that most of my functions are okay size-wise, but there's definitely room to improve. That `#shouldMask` function with the huge switch statement is probably the biggest issue - I could refactor it into separate functions for each mask pattern. Overall I tried to keep functions small and focused on one thing, which seems to match what Clean Code talks about. The bigger functions I have are mostly because of necessary data structures (like that finder pattern array) or because I need to handle multiple cases (the mask patterns) rather than trying to do too many different things in one function.
