# Clean Code Reflection - Public Function Names

| Function Name        | Description                                                                                      | Clean Code Rule Applied           | Reflection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generateQRCode`     | Main library function that creates a QR code matrix from input text with optional configuration. | **Use Intention-Revealing Names** | ✅ The name immediately reveals what the function does without needing to read implementation or comments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `renderASCIIMatrix`  | Converts a QR code matrix into ASCII art representation for console/text display.                | **Use Searchable Names**          | ✅ Contains specific keywords (ASCII, render, matrix) that make it easy to find when searching the codebase. Renaming it to only renderASCII is a thought I've had since it takes a matrix as an argument, which tells the developer already what the function is rendering in ASCII.                                                 |
| `validateInput`      | Checks if the provided text and options are valid for QR code generation.                        | **Use Verbs for Functions**       | ✅ Follows Clean Code principle that function names should be verbs indicating the action performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `buildDataCodewords` | Encodes input text into data codewords (bytes) according to QR code specification.               | **Use Domain Names**              | ✅ Uses "codewords" which is specific QR code domain terminology that domain experts would understand. Could be renamed to buildDataBytes since a codeword is equal to a byte which would instead be a solution domain named function. Because of educational purposes I went ahead and used codewords since qr codes are new for me. |
| `codewordsToBits`    | Utility function that converts an array of codewords (bytes) into a bit string.                  | **Make Meaningful Distinctions**  | ✅ Clearly distinguishes this conversion function from other similar functions by specifying both input and output types.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Previously in my coding experience I believe to have had reasonably named function/variables etc. but after reading chapter 2 I can look back and see some areas I could've named better. For example I don't believe all my functions had a verb to clearly describe what it did or made meaningful distinctions such as naming variables similar to eachother instead of making up a distinctful name (x, x2). There is one thing that I would like to disagree with and that is to use solution domain names instead of problem domain names. Personally I would like the code and documentation to use the specific terminology for the current problem domain instead of a more general solution domain name.
